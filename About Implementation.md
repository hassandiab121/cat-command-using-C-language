# cat-command-using-C-language
This code is a simulation for cat command in Linux (Unix based System) \n 
Details:\n
 . this program wcat can be invoked with one or more files on the command line; it should just print out each file in turn.
 . In all non-error cases, wcat should exit with status code 0, usually by returning a 0 from main() (or by calling exit(0)).
 . If no files are specified on the command line, wcat should just exit and return 0.
 . If the program tries to open a file and fails, it prints the exact message "wcat: cannot open file".
